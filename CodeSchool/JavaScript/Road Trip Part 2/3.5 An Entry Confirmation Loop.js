/*3.5 An Entry Confirmation Loop
We’ve learned to prompt the user for their age, and then confirm that their age has been entered correctly. Now we can use a while loop to improve the way this works.

Create a while loop that will continue to execute as long as the user has not entered the correct age. Inside the loop, provide a confirmation that the age has been entered correctly:

	"You entered <age>. Is this correct?"

If that confirmation statement is correct, then set ageIsCorrect to true and alert the following message:

	"Great! Your age is logged as <age>."

Otherwise, the loop should continue to prompt a user to enter their age and assign that value to the userAge variable:

	"What's your age, user?"*/

var userAge = prompt("What's your age, user?");
var ageIsCorrect = false;

while(ageIsCorrect == false){
  ageIsCorrect = confirm("You entered " + userAge + ". Is this correct?");
  userAge = prompt("What's your age, user?");
}
alert("Great! Your age is logged as " + userAge + ".");
